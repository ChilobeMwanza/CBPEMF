<p><strong>org.emf.persistence:</strong></p>
<p>In this project, a library model is created and persisted using emfs default persistence mechanisms (Binary and XMI). The persistence code is within the 'main' package. The Binary persistence code can be found in the BinaryPersistence.java file. The XMI persistence code can be found in the XMIPersistence.java file. By default both methods will save and load from to a location relative to the location of the eclipse project on disk. Command line arguments can be passed to both&nbsp;BinaryPersistence.java&nbsp;XMIPersistence.java in order to specify a save location, e.g C:/Test/output.xmi .</p>
